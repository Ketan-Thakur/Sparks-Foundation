                    The word ‘charity’ means generosity in giving some­thing to the needy out of loving kindness towards them; and a charitable organization is an institution with funds to help the needy.

                    There is a proverb: ‘Charity begins at home.’ A per­son, who is kind at heart and possesses compassion from his early days towards the weak and the needy in the society, is generally found to help and make gifts to the poor. He finds joy and satisfaction in giving alms to a beggar, or renders some financial relief to the needy persons who are near at hand.
                    
                    Thus charity begins at home. In other words, it begins in the near neighbourhoods of a person. One first comes forward to help his neighbours, relatives and friends in the very beginning. Afterwards, he extends his, same helping hand to the distant places, where thousands of the needy and the weak people await his help and sympathy.
